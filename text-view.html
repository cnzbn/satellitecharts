        <p class="body-text">The main visualization is a beeswarm chart showing 11,972 satellites launched between
          October 4th, 1957, and March 6th, 2022. Satellites are plotted by launch date and apogee (the maximum orbital
          distance

          Since Sputnik, the first satellite launched into Low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 4 October 1957, the
          race
          to space exploration has grown up steadily. Today, about 100 countries own, control, or co-operate one or more
          satellites in orbit.

          ground
          stations do not have to move to track the satellite. </p>
