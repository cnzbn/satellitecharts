      <div class="column right-text">
        <p class="body-text">A spaceport is a place for launching (or receiving) satellites and spacecraft. As much as a
          seaport or an airport, it is a logistic hub designated to control spaceflight activity. Today, 27 locations in
          the world
          are categorized as spaceports but several satellites have also been launched from missile test sites, from aircraft, submarines, and sea launch platforms. The map showcases satellite launch sites
          collected from a dataset of 11,972 payloads that successfully reached Earth’s Orbit between 1957 and March
          6th,
          2022.<br><br>

          Historically, orbital space launch operations have been usually located close to or within missile test
          facilities,
          taking advantage of the existing infrastructure and environmental factors. With the constant development of
          technology, it became natural to construct dedicated sites for satellite and spacecraft launch, considering
          geopolitical factors such as former colonies, land on lease, or alliances among nations.<br><br>

          Spaceports (or cosmodromes) can be designed for horizontal or vertical launches, for human or unmanned
          missions, and for
          launching large or small rockets. The chosen location has a direct impact on the propellent and
          velocity
          needed to successfully reach space. Rockets can enter much more easily in their designated orbit if launched
          at lower
          latitudes (near the equator) and pointed towards the East to maximize Earth’s rotation and speed. On the other
          hand,
          locating spaceports on the South or North of the planet is more optimal for launches to polar or near-polar
          orbits.

          Multiple launch complexes and nuclear weapons tests sites were built in the Sahara desert in Algeria, a former
          French colony, between the 40s-60s. The first facility was a rocket launch site at Hammaguir, near
          Colomb-Bechar, in 1947. The first French satellite Astérix was launched from here in 1965, followed by
          multiple launches over the next two years. After the establishment of Algerian independence in 1967, France
          was forced to abandon the facility. French missile test activities moved to Biscarosse, in France, and orbital
          launches to Kourou, in French Guiana.</p>

          The Luigi Broglio Space Centre (BSC) is an Italian-owned spaceport near Malindi, Kenya, developed in the 60s
          through a partnership between the University of Rome La Sapienza's Aerospace Research Centre and NASA. Italian
          and international satellites can be launched from a main offshore launch site, known as the San Marco platform
          (a former oil platform). The center is currently governed by a fifteen-year renewable agreement, signed for the first time in 1995,
          which allows to carry out launch, data acquisition from satellites, remote sensing and training activities both
          on the spot and in Italy. On its part, Italy commits to equip and manage the center, to provide the logistics
          and training, and to employ local workforce, while Kenya provides the site upon payment of a fee. The last
          satellite launch took place on March 25th, 1988. Currently the sea platform is not in use; the ground station
          is active but only to track satellites.</p>

          The Kennedy Space Center is a spaceport used both by national agencies and commercial
          companies. President John F. Kennedy's 1961 goal of a crewed lunar landing by 1970 required an expansion of
          the Cape Canaveral Space Center (in use since 1956). The area was inadequate to host the new launch facility
          designed to launch the Saturn V rocket. A new launch operation center was then built on a site adjacent to
          Cape Canaveral on Merritt Island. Since December 1968, The Kennedy Center has been NASA's primary launch
          center of human spaceflight: Apollo 11, the American spaceflight that first landed humans on the Moon in 1969,
          was launched from here.</p>

          Vandenberg was originally established as Camp Cooke in August of 1941 and used for army tank, infantry, and
          artillery training during World War II. In 1957, the installation property was transferred to the recently
          established U.S. Air Force and was soon transformed into the West Coast space and missile facility that is now
          Vandenberg SFB. The location, used by both civil and commercial companies such as NASA and SpaceX, is optimal

          from a floating platform. The mobile maritime launch complex (a former oil drilling rig) was constructed in
          Long Beach, California, and pulled to the Equatorial Pacific Ocean for launch by a dedicated ship. The
          platform was active between 1999 and 2014, sending payloads by custom-built rockets. In September 2016, a
          group of Russian companies called “7Space Companies” purchased the platform and brought it to Russia’s
          Slavyanka port, where currently resides, waiting to be equipped with GLONASS technologies.

          Wallops Flight Facility is a rocket launch site on Wallops Island on the Eastern Shore of Virginia, United
          States. It primarily supports science and exploration missions for NASA and other Federal agencies. The
          facility (named Wallop Station) was built in 1945 by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics to test
          rocket launches and conduct high-speed aerodynamic research. In 1958 the US Congress established the NASA
          space agency, which adsorbed all the other space federal agencies and acquired the Wallop Station. The site
          was active until 1985, the year of the last orbital launch; it fell into disuse until 2005, when the
          Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport was established. Orbital launches resumed in 2010.

          implementing launch pads, training and center, tracking station, airport, and hospital were very high:
          following issues with financing, the project was completely shut down in 2007 by Russian President Vladimir
          Putin.</p>

          The Tyuratam Missile and Space Complex, commonly known as Baikonur Cosmodrome, is the first and, to this day,
          largest cosmodrome in the world. Built in 1955, it was originally the base of operations for the
          Soviet space program. Both Sputnik 1, the first artificial satellite, and Vostok 1, the first human
          spaceflight, were launched from here. The origin of the name is mysterious: for the Americans, the site was
          named Tyuratam Missile and Space Complex after a reconnaissance plane found and photographed the missile test
          range in 1957. In the 60s, the Soviets started to call it Baikonur to mislead the Western bloc. After the
          breakup of the USSR, the Baikonur cosmodrome ended up on the territory of sovereign Kazakhstan, which now
          leases it to Russia - at least until 2050. Under the current Russian management, Baikonur remains a busy
          spaceport, with numerous commercial, military, and scientific missions being launched annually. </p>

          After World War II, the British government needed a large range to test the array of long-range missile
          systems then planned. Australia met the projected needs. The Long Range Weapons Establishment was created on 1
          April 1947 as a joint British/Australian enterprise; a town named in Woomera was built to become its
          administrative center. Most of the WTR operational area is under pastoral lease or Indigenous ownership. In
          the past decades, the complex has also been used for testing rockets, unmanned vehicles, aircraft and
          satellites. The very first Australian satellite ever sent to space was launched from here, in 1967.

          The Kagoshima Space Center was built in 1962 to launch large rockets with probe payloads. After the
          establishment of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in 2003, it was renamed to Uchinoura Space
          Center. From here, sounding rockets and scientific satellites are launched into space, including the
          first-ever Japanese satellite Ohsumi in 1970.

          The site, located on the island of Hainan, is a former suborbital test center. Chosen because of its position
          at the lowest land latitude in China and its proximity to the equator, two favourable conditions to reach
          geosynchronous orbit. The first launch was a Long March 7, which took place successfully in 2016. One year
          later, the Long March 5, the current most powerful Chinese rocket, performed its maiden flight. Delivered via
          port, the Long March 5 can only be launched from here due to its enormous size (5m diameter and 60m height),
          otherwise difficult to transport via rail tracks.

          The spaceport was constructed in the 1970s and first used to launch a payload into orbit in January 1984.
          Since then numerous civil, scientific, and military payloads have been launched annually. In 1996, a fatal
          accident occurred when the rocket carrying the Intelsat 708 satellite failed on launch and crashed 1200 meters
          away from the launch pad in a nearby mountain village, destroying 80 homes. In 2007, China conducted its first
          anti-satellite missile test targeting a Chinese weather satellite: the impact caused about 2,000 thousand space
          debris, a number growth over time due to further collisions among the pieces.

          Palmachim Air Force Base was built in the 1970s as a test site for missiles and as helicopter base, located on
          the coast of Israel south of Tel Aviv. The facility is also sometimes referred to as Yavne, which is the urban
          area near the Soreq nuclear research center. In the 80s, satellite launch tests were carried on, with the
          first Israelian satellite ever launched to space in 1987. The following launches were mainly regarding the
          Ofeq family of Earth observation satellites designed and built by Israel Aerospace Industries for the Israel
          Ministry of Defense. Due to range safety restrictions, Israel has pursued prograde orbits launches (from west to east) for its
          satellites by placing payloads on Russian, Chinese, Indian, and European launch systems.</p>

          India's primary (and only) space launch center is located on the east coast of the peninsula. The site was
          chosen in 1969 for building a satellite launching station, which became operational in 1971, with the launch
          of a suborbital rocket. Two failures in 1987 and 1988—including a catastrophic dive into the Bay of
          Bengal less than three minutes into the first launch attempt—led to a four year pause in Indian space launch
          until 1992. The Satish Dhawan Space Centre has been used to launch objects to all major orbital regimes,
          including LEO, MEO, GEO, and orbits around the Moon and Mars.
