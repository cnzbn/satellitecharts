      <p class="body-text"> Space junk is composed of human-made objects in space that are no longer functional. The
        category includes derelict spacecraft, abandoned launch vehicles, and fragmentation debris caused by collisions,
        erosion, unburned particles, or solidified liquids expelled from spacecraft. Since 1957, tonnes of rockets,
        spacecraft, and instruments have been launched into space. Initially, there was no plan for what to do with them
        at the end of their lives. But numbers have continued to increase: explosions and collisions in space
        have created hundreds of thousands of shards of dangerous fragments.
        <br><br>

        Space junk represents an enormous risk for current and future missions in space, as much for the security of
        human lives on Earth. Million of debris objects are smaller than 1 cm; most are even smaller micrometer-sized
        debris, while only a few thousands are larger than a softball. The greater part of the debris is currently
        orbiting in Low Earth orbit and can reach the speed of almost 30,000km per hour. LEO is also the orbit where
        most satellites are positioned: therefore, it is essential to keep track of these fragments to avoid impacts.

        that large objects can make it to the Earth's surface, one person has been already hit by a piece of Delta II
        rocket debris in 1997.

        small, they can cause damage to solar panels, optics, and windows. Small-size fragments constitute the highest
        mission-ending
        risk to most robotic spacecraft operating in low Earth orbit.

      <p class="body-text">The Kessler Syndrome is a phenomenon in which the amount of junk in orbit around Earth
        reaches a point where it just creates more and more space debris. Named after former NASA scientist Donald
        Kessler, the scenario described in his 1978 paper is likely already started. Debris-creating events have become
        more and more common: by today, the main cause is related to propulsion and anomalies during the many stages of
        launch and separation, followed by accidental, electrical, aerodynamical, and unknown cases. However, collisions
        between debris and working satellites are predicted to overtake explosions as the dominant source of debris.

          <span style="font-weight: 400; color:grey; font-size: 1em;">The Commonwealth of Independent States is an
            organization formed following the dissolution
            of the Soviet Union in 1991. It is composed by Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
            Moldova, Russia, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan.</span>

        <br><br><br>

        <p class="body-text" id="grid">The higher the altitude, the longer the orbital debris will remain in Earth's
          orbit. Debris located below 600 km normally fall back to Earth within several years. At altitudes of 800 km,
          the
          time for orbital decay is often measured in decades. Above 1,000 km, orbital debris normally will continue
          circling our planet for a century or more.<br><br>

          The main action to undertake is to prevent the creation of more orbital debris. Countries like the United
          States, Russia, China, Japan, France and the European Space Agency have issued guidelines to mitigate the risk
          of collision. Mathematical models have also been implemented to assess the direction and speed of debris, as
          well
          as tracking re-entering objects. Furthermore, several startups are studying and developing new technologies
          to
          retrieve debris such as the ELSA-d (End-of-Life Services by Astroscale Demonstration), developed by a
          Japan-based satellite services company. It consists of two satellites, a “servicer” satellite designed to
          remove
          debris from orbit and a “client” that captures them: the debris and service satellite will return to the
          Earth’s
          atmosphere together, burning up on re-entry.<br><br>

          Finding ways to remove the space junk should be a global priority, especially considering that Low Earth
          orbit is on the verge of becoming too crowded. Most of the recent commercial satellite constellations
          (SpaceX’s
          Starlink, OneWeb and the upcoming Amazon’s Project Kuiper) are located there, and they are all composed of
          thousands satellites. </p>
